       I am a results-driven Web Application Developer specializing in frontend development. Recently completing a comprehensive four-month Full Stack Bootcamp, I honed my skills in the MERN stack, notably during a two-month internship where I focused on building a React application, expanding my proficiency in React and API integration. Currently, as a full-time intern at Brava 360 Digital, I am refining my skills in WordPress and headless CMS systems like Next.js, further enhancing my understanding of backend technologies and content management solutions. Beyond development, I actively extend my expertise to SEO, quality assurance, and testing methodologies. As a proactive individual, I consistently exceed expectations. Simultaneously, I contribute as a freelance website developer, fostering connections and delivering impactful solutions for clients across the USA, Canada, Gulf countries, and Lebanon. This is just the beginning of my journey, and I eagerly anticipate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. "I thrive on the continuous learning inherent in this ever-evolving industryâ€”I never get bored."
